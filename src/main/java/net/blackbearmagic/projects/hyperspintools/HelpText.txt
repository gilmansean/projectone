This tool will read a source directory for files that match a given filter.
One of three actions is then performed on that list of files.

Directory Create Only:
    A new directory will be created in the destination directory with the
    name of the file, the file extension is stripped off.  For example
    for file "test.text" a directory will be created with the name "test".

File Move Only:
    The file found will be moved to it's matching named directory.

Create Directory and Move File:
    Both of the above actions are performed.

The "Choose Source" button will open a window where you will be able to choose 
a source directory used for looking for files.  If a directory is chosen all 
files will be scanned for name matches to the filter.  If a single file is 
chosen then that single file will be used as the filter and only that one file
will be used in the action list.

The "Choose Destination" button will open a window where you will be able to
choose a destination directory for the actions.  if a directory is chosen
that will be used as the base for the destination directory creates.  If a file
is chosen the files parent directory will be used as the destination.

The file filter is a text box where you can enter in text to match file names.
The filter is a Regular Expression string.  If you are unfamiliar with 
Regular Expressions here are some simple examples that should meet almost 
all your needs.
    .*              
        - matches anything and everything
    .*.txt          
        - matches all files with a ".txt" extension
    SomeText.*      
        - matches all files that begin with "SomeText"
    SomeText.*.txt  
        - matches all files that begin with "SomeText" and have a .txt extension
